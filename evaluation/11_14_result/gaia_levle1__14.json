It was also revealed that Wales had edited the Wikipedia article of his former company, Bomis. \"Bomis Babes\", a section of the Bomis website, had been characterized in the article as \"soft-core pornography\", but Wales revised this to \"adult content section\" and deleted mentions of pornography. He said he was fixing an error, and did not agree with calling Bomis Babes soft porn.

Among these, only \"No original research\" contains the letter \"R\" in its common abbreviation \"NOR\". Therefore, the \"R\" stands for \"Research\".

The user is asking about the meaning of \"R\" in the three core policies related to content violations on the Legume Wikipedia page, specifically before December 2022.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The question mentions \"three core policies\" and the \"type of content that was violated.\" The \"R\" stands for one of the policies. But I'm not sure which one. \n\nI remember that Wikipedia has various policies, like \"RfD\" (Request for Deletion) or \"RfA\" (Request for Adminship), but I'm not certain if these are part of the core policies. The user mentioned \"Legume Wikipedia page,\" which might be a specific page or a category. Wait, maybe \"Legume\" refers to a specific project or a page name. \n\nSince the user is asking about policies related to content violations, I should check what the core policies are. Common Wikipedia policies include \"RP\" (Respectful Protocol), \"RfC\" (Request for Comment), \"RfD\" (Request for Deletion), etc. But I need to confirm which ones are considered core. \n\nThe problem is that I don't have access to the specific Legume Wikipedia page's policies. So, I need to search for that information. The user mentioned \"public logs,\" which might indicate that the policies are documented somewhere. \n\nI should use the search tool to find the relevant information. The search model could help locate the policies mentioned on the Legume Wikipedia page. Let me check the available tools. The search models are search-1, search-2, and search-3. Search-3 is more effective at writing queries, so maybe that's the best choice. \n\nI need to construct a query to find the three core policies related to content violations on the Legume Wikipedia page. The query should look for policies that start with \"R\" and are part of the core policies. Alternatively, search for the specific page and look at its policies. \n\nOnce the search is done, the results might list the policies, and I can identify which one starts with \"R.\" If the search doesn't yield enough information, maybe the answer is known, like \"R\" standing for \"Respectful Protocol\" or another common policy. But without the specific context, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"R\" refers to a specific type of content, like \"R\" for \"Ratings\" or \"Revisions.\" But I need to be precise. The user is asking for the core policies, so it's likely one of the standard ones. \n\nIn any case, using the search tool with the right query should help find the answer. Let me proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n",

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out what the user is asking. The question is about the \"R\" in the three core policies related to content violations on the Legume Wikipedia page before December 2022. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user mentions \"three core policies\" and the \"R\" standing for something. Looking at the documents provided, I see several mentions of Wikipedia policies. Doc 2 and Doc 14 talk about Wikipedia's policies, including \"No original research\" (WP:OR), which is a key policy. \n\nThe user is asking about the \"R\" in the three core policies. The documents mention \"No original research\" as one of the policies. The other policies might be related to verifiability and neutral point of view, but the user specifically mentions the \"R\". \n\nLooking at Doc 14, there's a list of policies under the \"P\" category, including \"Verifiability\", \"No original research\", and \"Neutral point of view\". The \"R\" here could stand for \"No original research\". The user is asking about the \"R\" in the three core policies, so it's likely referring to \"No original research\". \n\nI need to confirm if there are three core policies mentioned. The documents mention \"No original research\", \"Verifiability\", and \"Neutral point of view\" as the three main policies. The \"R\" would stand for \"No original research\". \n\nSo, the answer is that \"R\" stands for \"No original research\" in the three core policies related to content violations on the Legume Wikipedia page.\n</think>\n\n",

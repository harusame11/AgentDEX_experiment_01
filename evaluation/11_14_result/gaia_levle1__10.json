While Emily Midkiff\u2019s focus is predominantly grounded in the uncanny, rather than id-ego-superego, her argument that \u201cdragons are doubles for humanity\u201d supports this hypothesis (Midkiff 43). Therefore the Freudian nature of the dragon-rider\u2019s bond is not terribly farfetched.

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to",

Identifications are sometimes further supported by surrounding imagery consistent with the story of F\u00e1fnir, and comparisons with other depictions. [...] In Nordic mythology, he is the son of Hrei\u00f0marr, and brother of Regin and \u00d3tr. He is attested throughout the V\u00f6lsung Cycle, where, F\u00e1fnir commits patricide out of greed, taking the ring and hoard of the dwarf \"Dwarf (folklore)\") Andvari, and shapeshifting into a dragon. F\u00e1fnir's brother Regin later assisted Sigur\u00f0 in obtaining the sword Gram \"Gram (mythology)\"), by which F\u00e1fnir is killed. F\u00e1fnir has been identified with an unnamed dragon killed by a V\u00f6lsung in other Germanic works, including Beowulf, the Nibelunglied and a number of skaldic poems. F\u00e1fnir and his killing by Sigur\u00f0 are further represented in numerous medieval carvings from the British Isles and Scandinavia, and a single axe head in a Scandinavian style found in Russia.

As told in the V\u00f6lsunga saga (\u201cSaga of the Volsungs\u201d), Fafnir slew his father, Hreithmar, to obtain the vast amount of gold which Hreithmar had demanded of Odin as a compensation for the loss of one of his sons. Odin gave the gold but put a curse on it. Full of greed, Fafnir changed into a dragon to guard his treasure and was later slain by the young hero Sigurd. Sigurd was spurred on by another brother of Fafnir, the blacksmith Regin. Once Sigurd, under the advice of Odin, had killed Fafnir, Regin asked him to cook the dragon\u2019s heart for him.

          "The transformation of Fafnir into a dragon highlights the transformative power of mythical creatures in Norse mythology. Fafnir\u2019s physical metamorphosis mirrors the internal transformation caused by greed, illustrating how unchecked desires can alter one\u2019s very essence.\n\nAdditionally, Fafnir\u2019s dragon form emphasizes the awe-inspiring power and primal nature of mythical creatures. As a dragon, Fafnir becomes a force to be reckoned with, embodying strength, fear, and the  untamed aspects of nature.\n\nThis theme underscores the importance of respecting and understanding the immense power that mythical creatures hold within Norse mythology.\n\n### Fafnir\u2019s Impact on Norse and Medieval European Literature [...] In conclusion, Fafnir\u2019s role as the god of war in Norse mythology was one of unmatched strength, strategic prowess, and destructive power.

          "Dragon carvings are one of the signature cultural artifacts of the old norse. Primarily as far as I'm aware they carved them into ships and also as decorations for stave churches. This seems kind of weird to me considering the mythology we know. One dragon, fafnir, is a big bad and associated with greed. Another dragon is Jormangandr who kills the great hero of norse mythology Thor. Finally you have nidhogg who's name literally has a word \"N\u00ed\u00f0\" in it indicating villain status or dishonor. So what the heck is going on with all these dragons carved into everything if dragons are so villainous in mythology.

Originally a dwarf, Fafnir was transformed into a fearsome dragon due to his insatiable desire for gold.\n\nHis story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of greed, showing how wealth can corrupt even the noblest beings.\n\n#### The Story of Sigurd and Fafnir\n\nThe tale begins with Fafnir\u2019s father, Hreidmar, who captured Loki, the trickster god, after he killed Hreidmar\u2019s son, Otter.

Identifications are sometimes further supported by surrounding imagery consistent with the story of F\u00e1fnir, and comparisons with other depictions. [...] In Nordic mythology, he is the son of Hrei\u00f0marr, and brother of Regin and \ufffd\ufffdtr.

In a world of myths, the mighty dragon Fafnir symbolizes greed and broken trust. His story is about a family destroyed by a cursed treasure, leading to a tale of revenge and bravery. Once a man, Fafnir became a dragon to guard his gold, driven by greed stronger than the gods. His life, marked by fights and loneliness, shows how greed can destroy.\n\n#norse #mythology #dragon #serpent [...] his father rmar to seize all the gold to protect his spoils and himself from his potentially vengeful brother rean who might desire a share fafnir transformed into a dragon a GU mirrored his avarice and Malice he retreated to a remote Forest where he hoarded the gold gradually fusing with it both physically and spiritually fafnir's t\n\nDoc 17: # Fafnir\n\na white dragon flying over a forest filled with trees\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests\n\nSmaug Dragon Art, Smaug Treasure, Smaug Artwork, Hobbit Dragon Gold, Smaug And Gold, Smaug On Treasure, Smaug Covered In Gold, Fantasy Dragon In Cave, Medieval Dragon Landscape\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests\n\na red dragon sitting on top of a pile of gold\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Description\n\n### Related interests\n\na man standing in front of a giant building\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Description\n\n### Related interests\n\na dragon is attacking another creature in a dark room with gold leaves on the floor\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests\n\nan image of a dragon and other animals in a cave\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests [...] ### Description\n\n### Related interests\n\nMedieval Mythology Dragon Art, Beowulf Dragon, Blue Dragon Medieval Illustration, Walter Crane Dragon, Old Dragon Illustration, Dragon Vintage Illustration, Medieval Boo\n\nDoc 18: a drawing of a red dragon sitting on top of a castle with flames coming out of its wings\na black and white dragon with red eyes on it's face, surrounded by lightning\nan anime character with red eyes and black hair looking at the camera while staring into the distance\ntwo men are walking in the snow near a large dragon\na painting of a black dragon sitting on top of a stone wall with its wings spread out\nan image of a monster that is laying on the ground in front of a waterfall\nan anime character with long black hair wearing a suit and tie, standing in front of three\nan anime character holding a camera and looking at something in the distance with red eyes\nan illustration of a giant dragon with its mouth open and glowing green on it's back\na black and white drawing of a cow with red eyes [...] # Fafnir dragon\n\n## Related interests\n\n## Explore related boards\n\n## Dragons\n\n## Fantasy artwork\n\n## adopt temp\n\n## Animals\n\n## Monsters [...] a black and white drawing of a cow with red eyes\nan im\n\nDoc 19: The transformation of Fafnir into a dragon highlights the transformative power of mythical creatures in Norse mythology. Fafnir\u2019s physical metamorphosis mirrors the internal transformation caused by greed, illustrating how unchecked desires can alter one\u2019s very essence.\n\nAdditionally, Fafnir\u2019s dragon form emphasizes the awe-inspiring power and primal nature of mythical creatures. As a dragon, Fafnir becomes a force to be reckoned with, embodying strength, fear, and the  untamed aspects of nature.\n\nThis theme underscores the importance of respecting and understanding the immense power that mythical creatures hold within Norse mythology.\n\n### Fafnir\u2019s Impact on Norse and Medieval European Literature [...] In conclusion, Fafnir\u2019s role as the god of war in Norse mythology was one of unmatched strength, strategic prowess, and destructive power. His involvement in battle  shaped the narratives of legendary conflicts, and his connections to other gods added depth and complexity to his story.\n\n\nDoc 20: Dragon carvings are one of the signature cultural artifacts of the old norse. Primarily as far as I'm aware they carved them into ships and also as decorations for stave churches. This seems kind of weird to me considering the mythology we know. One dragon, fafnir, is a big bad and associated with greed. Another dragon is Jormangandr who kills the great hero of norse mythology Thor. Finally you have nidhogg who's name literally has a word \"N\u00ed\u00f0\" in it indicating villain status or dishonor. So what the heck is going on with all these dragons carved into everything if dragons are so villainous in mythology. Is it supposed to be like hanging the head of a lion above your fireplace to show how cool you are? It just seems weird to me.\n\n# Related Answers Section [...] r/Norse icon\n\n# Why Did Old Norse Peoples Carve Dragons Into Things Despite Them Generally Being Negative Forces?

Odin gave the gold but put a curse on it. Full of greed, Fafnir changed into a dragon to guard his treasure and was later slain by the young hero Sigurd.

In a world of myths, the mighty dragon Fafnir symbolizes greed and broken trust. His story is about a family destroyed by a cursed treasure, leading to a tale of revenge and bravery. Once a man, Fafnir became a dragon to guard his gold, driven by greed stronger than the gods. His life, marked by fights and loneliness, shows how greed can destroy.\n\n#norse #mythology #dragon #serpent [...] his father rmar to seize all the gold to protect his spoils and himself from his potentially vengeful brother rean who might desire a share fafnir transformed into a dragon a GU mirrored his avarice and Malice he retreated to a remote Forest where he hoarded the gold gradually fusing with it both physically and spiritually fafnir's t\n\nDoc 17: # Fafnir\n\na white dragon flying over a forest filled with trees\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests\n\nSmaug Dragon Art, Smaug Treasure, Smaug Artwork, Hobbit Dragon Gold, Smaug And Gold, Smaug On Treasure, Smaug Covered In Gold, Fantasy Dragon In Cave, Medieval Dragon Landscape\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests\n\na red dragon sitting on top of a pile of gold\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Description\n\n### Related interests\n\na man standing in front of a giant building\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Description\n\n### Related interests\n\na dragon is attacking another creature in a dark room with gold leaves on the floor\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests\n\nan image of a dragon and other animals in a cave\n\n## More about this Pin\n\n### Related interests [...] ### Description\n\n### Related interests\n\nMedieval Mythology Dragon Art, Beowulf Dragon, Blue Dragon Medieval Illustration, Walter Crane Dragon, Old Dragon Illustration, Dragon Vintage Illustration, Medieval Boo\n\nDoc 18: a drawing of a red dragon sitting on top of a castle with flames coming out of its wings\na black and white dragon with red eyes on it's face, surrounded by lightning\nan anime character with red eyes and black hair looking at the camera while staring into the distance\ntwo men are walking in the snow near a large dragon\na painting of a black dragon sitting on top of a stone wall with its wings spread out\nan image of a monster that is laying on the ground in front of a waterfall\nan anime character with long black hair wearing a suit and tie, standing in front of three\nan anime character holding a camera and looking at something in the distance with red eyes\nan illustration of a giant dragon with its mouth open and glowing green on it's back\na black and white drawing of a cow with red eyes [...] # Fafnir dragon\n\n## Related interests\n\n## Explore related boards\n\n## Dragons\n\n## Fantasy artwork\n\n## adopt temp\n\n## Animals\n\n## Monsters [...] a black and white drawing of a cow with red eyes\nan im\n\nDoc 19: The transformation of Fafnir into a dragon highlights the transformative power of mythical creatures in Norse mythology. Fafnir\u2019s physical metamorphosis mirrors the internal transformation caused by greed, illustrating how unchecked desires can alter one\u2019s very essence.\n\nAdditionally, Fafnir\u2019s dragon form emphasizes the awe-inspiring power and primal nature of mythical creatures. As a dragon, Fafnir becomes a force to be reckoned with, embodying strength, fear, and the  untamed aspects of nature.\n\nThis theme underscores the importance of respecting and understanding the immense power that mythical creatures hold within Norse mythology.\n\n### Fafnir\u2019s Impact on Norse and Medieval European Literature [...] In conclusion, Fafnir\u2019s role as the god of war in Norse mythology was one of unmatched strength, strategic prowess, and destructive power. His involvement in battle  shaped the narratives of legendary conflicts, and his connections to other gods added depth and complexity to his story.\n\n\nDoc 20: Dragon carvings are one of the signature cultural artifacts of the old norse. Primarily as far as I'm aware they carved them into ships and also as decorations for stave churches. This seems kind of weird to me considering the mythology we know. One dragon, fafnir, is a big bad and associated with greed. Another dragon is Jormangandr who kills the great hero of norse mythology Thor. Finally you have nidhogg who's name literally has a word \"N\u00ed\u00f0\" in it indicating villain status or dishonor. So what the heck is going on with all these dragons carved into everything if dragons are so villainous in mythology. Is it supposed to be like hanging the head of a lion above your fireplace to show how cool you are? It just seems weird to me.\n\n# Related Answers Section [...] r/Norse icon\n\n# Why Did Old Norse Peoples Carve Dragons Into Things Despite Them Generally Being Negative Forces?

From Fafnir\u2019s tragic transformation to Nidhogg\u2019s eternal vigilance beneath Yggdrasil, these legends continue to captivate imaginations today.\n\nUnderstanding these dragons enriches our appreciation for the things Norse started, offering a glimpse into their worldview through the lens of myth.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## Understanding Dragons in Norse Mythology\n\nDragons hold a prominent place among the creatures in Norse mythology, embodying more than mere beasts of destruction.

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to answer this question. The user is asking about a specific detail from Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article. The journal's name is mentioned as being named for one of Hreidmar's sons who guarded his house. Then, the question is about a word quoted from two different authors who expressed distaste for dragon depictions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the components of the question. The main elements are:\n\n1. Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article.\n2. The journal's name relates to Hreidmar's sons and their house guardian.\n3. A word quoted from two authors criticizing dragon depictions.\n\nI think the first step is to identify the journal's name. Hreidmar is a figure from Norse mythology. His sons are known in the story of Sigurd. Specifically, Hreidmar's sons are \u00d3fnir and H\u00f8f\u00f0i, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe it's referring to a different mythological reference. Alternatively, the journal's name might be a play on words. The user mentioned \"the one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house.\" Maybe the journal is named after one of his sons who was a guardian. \n\nWait, in the story of Sigurd, Hreidmar is the father of Regin, who is the one who crafts the dragon's treasure. But I'm not certain about the sons' names. Maybe the journal's name is \"Hreidmar's Son\" or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reference to a specific journal name that's a play on a mythological figure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the journal's name is \"Hreidmar's Son\" or \"Hreidmar's Guardian.\" But I'm not sure. This part is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to search for the journal's name first. \n\nOnce the journal's name is known, the next step is to find Emily Midkiff's article from June 2014 in that journal. Then, look for the word quoted from two different authors in distaste for dragon depictions. \n\nBut how to find the journal's name? The user says the journal is named for one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house. So, perhaps the son's name is the journal's name. Let me think about Hreidmar's sons. In the Volsungasaga, Hreidmar is the father of Regin, who is the one who creates the dragon's treasure. But Regin is not a son guarding the house. Wait, maybe it's referring to the story where Hreidmar's sons are killed by Sigurd. Alternatively, maybe the journal's name is \"Hreidmar's Son\" or \"Hreidmar's Guardian.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the journal's name is \"Hreidmar's Son\" or \"Hreidmar's Guardian.\" But I'm not sure. This part is a bit tricky. Maybe I should use the search tool to find the journal's name. \n\nSo, the first step is to search for the journal's name. The user mentions that the journal is named for one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house. So, perhaps the son's name is the key here. Let me try to recall Norse mythology. Hreidmar's sons are \u00d3fnir and H\u00f8f\u00f0i. Wait, in the story, Hreidmar's sons are killed by Sigurd, but I'm not sure if they guarded his house. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to a different son. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the journal's name is \"Hreidmar's Son\" or \"Hreidmar's Guardian.\" But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nOnce the journal's name is identified, the next step is to find Emily Midkiff's article from June 2014. Then, look for the word quoted from two authors criticizing dragon depictions. \n\nBut since I don't have access to the actual content of the article, I might need to use the search tool to find the necessary information. However, the search tool's parameters require a model. The user hasn't specified which model to use, so I need to choose an appropriate one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is a well-known term related to dragon depictions. For example, the word \"serpents\" or \"dragons\" themselves, but the question specifies a word quoted from two different authors in distaste. Maybe the word is \"monstrous\" or \"evil,\" but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the word is \"dragon\" itself, but that seems too obvious. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be a specific term from literary criticism. For example, \"mythic\" or \"symbolic,\" but again, I'm not certain. \n\nGiven the complexity, I think the best approach is to first identify the journal's name. Let me try to search for that. Using the search tool with model search-3, which is more effective for identifying missing information. \n\nSo, the first tool call would be to search for the journal's name. The query would be: \"journal named for one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house.\" \n\nOnce the journal's name is found, then I can look into Emily Midkiff's article from June 2014 in that journal. Then, find the word quoted from two authors. \n\nBut since I can't access external information, I need to rely on the tools provided. The search tool might help find the journal's name. Let me proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n",

      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to answer this question. The user is asking about a word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions in Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the journal named for one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the journal. The user mentioned it's named for one of Hreidmar's sons that guarded his house. From the documents, I see that Fafnir is mentioned as a son of Hreidmar in Norse mythology. The journal name is Fafnir, which is also the name of the dragon in the story. So the journal is Fafnir.\n\nNext, I need to find Emily Midkiff's 2014 article in Fafnir. Looking at the documents, Doc 3 and Doc 8 mention her article titled \u201c'Dragons are Tricksy': The Uncanny Dragons of Children\u2019s Literature\u201d published in Fafnir in 2014. \n\nNow, the question is about a word quoted from two different authors that express distaste for dragon depictions. The documents mention several authors. For example, Doc 4 references John C. Stott and Emily Midkiff. Doc 11 cites Midkiff 2014. Doc 14 mentions Yang, G.L., Oziewicz, M., and Midkiff, E. \n\nWait, the user says the word was quoted from two different authors. Looking at Doc 11, there's a citation to Midkiff 2014, but that's only one author. Maybe in the article itself, Midkiff quotes other authors. The abstract in Doc 8 mentions that scholars have noted a trend to soften and satirize dragons, which has been bemoaned. The word \"bemoaned\" might be part of it. \n\nLooking at Doc 7, there's a mention of \"bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons.\" The authors mentioned here are scholars of children\u2019s literature. But the question specifies two different authors. Maybe in the article, Midkiff quotes two authors who criticize dragon depictions. \n\nAlternatively, in Doc 14, the authors listed include Midkiff and others. But I need to find the exact word. The user is asking for a word that was quoted from two authors in distaste. The word might be \"tricksy\" from the article title, but that's from Midkiff. \n\nWait, the article title is \u201c'Dragons are Tricksy'\u201d, which is a quote from the article. But the question says the word was quoted from two different authors. Maybe the word is \"tricksy\", but that's from Midkiff's own work. Alternatively, looking at Doc 4, it mentions John C. Stott and Emily Midkiff. Stott's work is cited as discussing the use of dragons in children's fiction. Maybe the word comes from Stott and another author. \n\nAlternatively, in Doc 11, the text says \"This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons.\" The word \"bemoaned\" is used here, but it's attributed to scholars, not specific authors. \n\nWait, the user says the word was quoted from two different authors. Maybe the word is \"uncanny\", which is a keyword in the article. But again, that's from Midkiff. \n\nI think I need to check the full text of the article. The documents mention that in the article, Midkiff discusses how dragons are portrayed as uncanny. But the question specifies two authors. Maybe the answer is \"tricksy\" and \"uncanny\", but that's from the same author. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Doc 14, there's a citation to Yang, G.L., Oziewicz, M., and Midkiff, E. Perhaps the word is from Oziewicz and another author. But without the full text, it's challenging. \n\nWait, the user's question might be referring to the word \"tricksy\" from the article title, which is quoted from two different authors. But since the article is by Midkiff, maybe she quotes two authors in her work. The answer might be \"tricksy\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the word could be \"bemoaned\" from the abstract. \n\nI think the correct answer is the word \"tricksy\", as it's mentioned in the article title and possibly quoted from two authors. But I need to confirm. Since the documents don't provide the exact word, maybe the answer is \"tricksy\" based on the article's title and the context of the question.\n</think>\n\n",
